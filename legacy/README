Hafen Layer Util
================

Hafen Layer Util is a resource utility for decoding and encoding the Hafen/Haven/Salem resource files (.res/.cached)

Install
=======
There's two different approaches you can choose from.

The first requires you to find yourself a Common Lisp compiler of your choice (SBCL,CMUCL,CLISP, etc) and follow the following:

* run your CL compiler and setup quicklisp
* go to ~/quicklisp/local-projects
* git clone git://github.com/boshaw/hafen-layer-util.git
* run your CL compiler and type (ql:quicklisp "hafen-layer-util")

Alternately you can run it through the abcl.jar provided by using run-abcl.{bat,sh}
depending on the OS you use. This should load up the files needed for you and let you
get straight to usage. 

Usage
=====
* Start up sbcl/run-abcl in the directory in the directory you wish to work relative from
(hafen-layer-util:run KEYS) or (hlu:run KEYS)
Possible KEYS include:
 (:mode              Determines the mode of the program 
                      [DEFAULT-VALUE: :d]
   Possible modes include:
    :d              Decodes file(s) given through ARGS by list of pathnames
                     default output folder: dout
    :e              Encodes file(s) given through ARGS by list of pathnames
                     default output folder: dres
    :da             Decodes a set of files within a specified directory into another
    :ea             Encodes a set of files within a specified directory into another
    :cached->res    Renames a set of files withina  specified directory from *.cached
                    to *.res)
   Note: for :da and :ea the two directories needed should be provided through &key args
         first arg within the args list should be source-folder
         second arg within the args list should be result-folder
 (:skip-old t/nil)   Skip processing older files 
                      [DEFAULT-VALUE: t]
 (:verbose t/nil)    Be verbose 
                      [DEFAULT-VALUE: t]
 (:print-skip t/nil) Print skipped files 
                      [DEFAULT-VALUE: nil]
 (:threads n)        Number of threads to execute decoding/encoding of files 
                      [DEFAULT-VALUE: 1]
                      As of right now threads key doesn't change anything.
 (:layers "path-to-layers") Tells the layer-util what layer files it should load for
                             decoding and encoding
                             [DEFAULT-VALUE: "layers/salem"] 
 (:args '(...))      A list of arguments for the mode given

Sample Usage:
;;Decode two files: res/[1,2].res into dout
(hafen-layer-util:run :mode :d
                      :args '("res/1.res" "res/2.res"))
;;Decode all res/cache files from res folder into dec folder
;; using hnh layers instead of salem
(hafen-layer-util:run :mode :da
                      :skip-old nil
                      :layers "layers/hnh"
                      :args '("res" "dec"))
;;Encode only new res/cache files from dec folder into res folder
(hafen-layer-util:run :mode :ea
                      :args '("dec" "res"))


Skipping of older files is based completely off last modified date times
